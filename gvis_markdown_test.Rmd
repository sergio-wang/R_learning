## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, dependson='gv',results='asis', cache=TRUE}

library(googleVis)
G <- gvisGeoChart(Exports, locationvar = "Country",
                  colorvar="Profit",options=list(width=600, height=400))
print(G,"chart")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, dependson='gv',results='asis', cache=TRUE}

library(googleVis)
G2 <- gvisGeoChart(Exports, locationvar = "Country",
                  colorvar="Profit",options=list(width=600, height=400,region="150"))
print(G2,"chart")
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
